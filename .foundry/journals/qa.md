## Task Verification & Memory Recording
When verifying tasks that involve adding or modifying parsers for save files (like `task-124-172-gen3-mix-record-events-parser`), make sure to closely inspect that they properly catch `RangeError` from the `DataView` API when checking for out-of-bounds reads.
Always ensure you run `pnpm lint && pnpm test` to verify no regressions were introduced.
When you finish reviewing a node, do not modify the YAML frontmatter. Update only the markdown body by checking off the Acceptance Criteria.
Code fix added missing generation check for ContestSheenDisplay during validation.
