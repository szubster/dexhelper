# 2026-04-23 - Task 018

Successfully implemented the Scheduled Agent Registry by creating the GitHub Actions workflows for TPM and Agile Coach personas.

Verified empty state prompt inclusion in scheduled-agent workflow by extracting the jq construction step and confirming the format locally. Also checked the task as completed.

### Task: task-017-041-fix-jest-standalone-expect
- Re-enabled `jest/no-standalone-expect` in `.oxlintrc.json`.
- To avoid oxlint throwing false positives on `expect` calls inside Vitest's custom test functions, added `additionalTestBlockFunctions` to the rule configuration:
  `"jest/no-standalone-expect": ["error", { "additionalTestBlockFunctions": ["customTest", "customTest.for", "customTest.each"] }]`
- Verified `pnpm exec oxlint .` and `pnpm test` passed.


## Refactor State Store Sync
- Replaced `localStorage` Base64 logic with `saveDB` fetching raw `Uint8Array`.
- Refactored tests to use async and mocked `saveDB`.
- Verification steps: `pnpm test` and `pnpm lint` passed.
