# Epic Planner Journal

## Session 2026-07-08
**Context:** Resuming work on `prd-070-043-roamer-tracking-dashboard`.
**Observation:** The PRD is currently in the ACTIVE state. However, its acceptance criteria checkboxes show that the child epics (`epic-043-139...`, `epic-043-140...`, `epic-043-142...`, `epic-043-143...`) and the `research-043-263-roamer-tracking-remediation` node have already been correctly generated and appended.
**Action:** Since the work is already complete (the child nodes exist), and the orchestrator handles demoting ACTIVE nodes back to PENDING if their child nodes are not yet COMPLETE (and the PRD's own checkboxes correctly remain unchecked to comply with the Late-Binding Orchestrator Demotion Compliance Rule), I am submitting an empty PR to allow the orchestrator to correctly demote the node to PENDING. No file changes are required.

## Session 2026-07-09
**Context:** Processing PRD `prd-071-040-tailwind-v4-utilities-migration`.
**Observation:** The PRD is currently in the READY state. However, its acceptance criteria checkboxes show that the child epics (`epic-071-123...`, `epic-071-124...`, `epic-071-125...`, `epic-071-126...`) have already been correctly generated and appended.

**Context:** Processing PRD `prd-071-044-gen3-roamer-tracker`.
**Observation:** The PRD is currently in the READY state. However, its acceptance criteria checkboxes show that the child epics (`epic-044-149-gen3-roamer-core-extraction-v4`, `epic-044-150-gen3-roamer-iv-glitch-v4`, `epic-044-151-gen3-roamer-dashboard-ui-v6`) have already been correctly generated and appended.

## Tailwind v4 @utility Consolidation Epic Creation
I have generated the necessary child epic nodes (`epic-071-123-define-tailwind-v4-utilities-v2`, `epic-071-124-migrate-core-tactical-components-v2`, `epic-071-125-migrate-complex-app-components-v2`, `epic-071-126-tailwind-designer-persona-v2`) and appended them as unchecked boxes to the PRD `prd-071-040-tailwind-v4-utilities-migration`. As per the Late-Binding Orchestrator Demotion Compliance Rule, I will submit an empty PR directly via the `submit` tool, which will allow the Orchestrator to calculate the dependencies and demote the PRD node from READY to PENDING until the generated Epics are COMPLETED. I am intentionally not checking off the child epic checkboxes on the parent PRD to respect this lifecycle.

## Session 2026-07-10 (Later)
**Context:** Processing PRD `prd-070-043-roamer-tracking-dashboard`.
**Observation:** The PRD is currently in the ACTIVE state. However, its acceptance criteria checkboxes show that the child epics (`epic-043-139-gen2-roamer-data-extraction`, `epic-043-140-gen2-roamer-map-translation`, `epic-043-142-gen2-roamer-radar-widget`, `epic-043-143-gen2-roamer-map-integration`) and the `research-043-263-roamer-tracking-remediation` node have already been correctly generated and appended.
**Action:** Since the work is already complete (the child nodes exist), and the orchestrator handles demoting ACTIVE nodes back to PENDING if their child nodes are not yet COMPLETE (and the PRD's own checkboxes correctly remain unchecked to comply with the Late-Binding Orchestrator Demotion Compliance Rule), I am submitting an empty PR to allow the orchestrator to correctly demote the node to PENDING. No file changes are required.

## Session 2026-07-10
**Context:** Processing PRD prd-070-043-roamer-tracking-dashboard.

**Action:** Submitted PR with new epics and updated PRD checkboxes.
