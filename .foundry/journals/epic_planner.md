# Epic Planner Journal

## Session 2026-07-08
**Context:** Resuming work on `prd-070-043-roamer-tracking-dashboard`.
**Observation:** The PRD is currently in the ACTIVE state. However, its acceptance criteria checkboxes show that the child epics (`epic-043-139...`, `epic-043-140...`, `epic-043-142...`, `epic-043-143...`) and the `research-043-263-roamer-tracking-remediation` node have already been correctly generated and appended.
**Action:** Since the work is already complete (the child nodes exist), and the orchestrator handles demoting ACTIVE nodes back to PENDING if their child nodes are not yet COMPLETE (and the PRD's own checkboxes correctly remain unchecked to comply with the Late-Binding Orchestrator Demotion Compliance Rule), I am submitting an empty PR to allow the orchestrator to correctly demote the node to PENDING. No file changes are required.
