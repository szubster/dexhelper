## 2024-05-18 - 🧬 Oak: [Gen 1 Yellow Exclusives correction]
**What was wrong:** Sandshrew, Sandslash, and Pinsir were incorrectly listed as unobtainable (exclusives) in Yellow version, while Electabuzz was missing from the unobtainable list.
**Canonical source used:** PokeAPI encounters (`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${id}/encounters`).
**Impact on users:** Users playing Yellow version will now correctly see that they can catch Sandshrew, Sandslash, and Pinsir, and will correctly be told they need to trade for Electabuzz.
**Learning:** PokeAPI encounter endpoints are the absolute source of truth for base-form version availability, especially for complex cases like Yellow version where availability diverges significantly from Red/Blue.

## Data Integrity - Gen 1 Exclusives
*   **ROM parsing quirks / Data Pipeline Gotchas:** The version exclusivity arrays in `src/engine/exclusives/gen1Exclusives.ts` operate as *exclusion* lists, not inclusion lists. The array for `red` must contain the IDs of Pokémon that are **missing** or **unobtainable** in Red (which are the Blue exclusives), and vice versa. This is counter-intuitive initially, but required because `getUnobtainableReason` checks if a Pokémon ID `.includes` in the version's list to determine if it should be locked. Always verify whether a data array in the engine is intended to represent "available" or "unavailable" entities before modifying it.

## Data Integrity - Evolution Chains
*   **ROM parsing quirks / Data Pipeline Gotchas:** Some Gen 2 Pokémon evolutions (like Tyrogue -> Hitmonlee/Hitmonchan/Hitmontop) depend on the Pokémon's stats (Attack > Defense, Attack < Defense, or Attack == Defense). PokeAPI models this via `relative_physical_stats` in the `evolution_details`. Ensure the schema (`CompactEvolutionDetail`) and data generation script (`scripts/generate-pokedata.ts`) correctly map `relative_physical_stats` (to `rps`) so the application logic can accurately evaluate these conditional evolutions.

## 2026-04-24 - 🧪 Oak: [data correction]
**What was wrong:** The file \`.foundry/stories/story-010-015-enforce-strict-oxlint-rules.md\` was missing the mandatory \`jules_session_id\` frontmatter field, causing the orchestrator to skip the node during DAG resolution.
**Canonical source used:** Foundry Orchestrator error logs and project frontmatter requirements.
**Impact on users:** Restores the story node and its dependencies to the active DAG resolution, ensuring that the work planned for enforcing strict oxlint rules can proceed.
**Learning:** The \`jules_session_id\` field is a hard requirement for the Foundry DAG orchestrator parser in strict mode. All node files under \`.foundry/\` (PRDs, Epics, Stories, Tasks) must include this field, even if set to \`null\`, to avoid being skipped during discovery.
