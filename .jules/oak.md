## 2024-05-18 - 🧬 Oak: [Gen 1 Yellow Exclusives correction]
**What was wrong:** Sandshrew, Sandslash, and Pinsir were incorrectly listed as unobtainable (exclusives) in Yellow version, while Electabuzz was missing from the unobtainable list.
**Canonical source used:** PokeAPI encounters (`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${id}/encounters`).
**Impact on users:** Users playing Yellow version will now correctly see that they can catch Sandshrew, Sandslash, and Pinsir, and will correctly be told they need to trade for Electabuzz.
**Learning:** PokeAPI encounter endpoints are the absolute source of truth for base-form version availability, especially for complex cases like Yellow version where availability diverges significantly from Red/Blue.
