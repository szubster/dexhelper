* When using static analysis tools like `knip` to find unused exports, you must explicitly verify candidates using a global repository search (e.g., `grep`) before removal to ensure they are not implicitly required by tests, mocks, or CI scripts.
* Scheduled or foundry agents can dynamically spawn new IDEA, TASK, RESEARCH, or ADR nodes in the `.foundry/` directory to handle larger architectural changes or missing context, ensuring the `owner_persona` is set to the appropriate role (e.g., 'researcher' for RESEARCH).
