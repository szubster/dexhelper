## 2024-03-31 - Assistant Evolution Item Suggestion
**Learning:** The item evolution check was verifying if an evolution stone existed in `saveData.inventory`, but was not checking its `quantity`. This could cause false "Ready to Evolve" suggestions if the save parser left 0-quantity items in the inventory array.
**Action:** Always check `quantity > 0` when verifying player items in `saveData.inventory`.
