## 2025-04-19 - [Accepted] - New agent: Sweeper (Code Health & Tech Debt)
**Type:** New agent
**Outcome:** Accepted
**Why:** Proposal submitted to maintainer and maintainer instructed to add the agent directly.
**Pattern:** Proposing based on hints in memory (code health PR prefix). Note: The user explicitly wants to keep both `bundlemon` and Codecov Vite plugin in the project. They are used intentionally in parallel, so agents should never remove `bundlemon` as an "unused" dependency.
